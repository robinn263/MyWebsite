			High School</a> in Walpole, MA. While I made many good memories at NCAHS, I am honored to be a student at Mass Academy and collaborate with

		<p>All through the year, I work as a kennel assistant at a vet clinic.
		 My duties include walking dogs, feeding the animals, cleaning cages, and scrubbing 
		 the entire clinic. I also stock the medical supplies, hold animals for treatment, 
	 	and assist with appointments. This job has given me tons of experience 
		 in my field of interest, and has allowed me to work closely with veterinarians and
		  technicians. 
		  </p>
		  
		 <p>
		 In this picture, I am holding a baby pug named Wally that one of our technicians saved. He
		  was born with a cleft palate, so he had to be hand-fed for months! Just recently, one of our
		  vets performed corrective surgery to fix his palate. Wally made a perfect recovery!
		  </p>
		  
		  <p> I feel super lucky to be able to work at a vet clinic as a teenager. Not many kids are
		  able to say that they get to watch surgeries every week or help give fluids! The greater sense
		  of purpose that comes with this job is unmatched. Veterinary science is more than just clinical skills -
		  the science behind every decision we make is incredible. 
		There is so much to be learned in this setting, from the best ways to restrain a dog to
		treatment plans for cats with kidney disease. The combination of constant personal development and field development makes this job amazing.

	<h2 class="smallheading"> Equestrian</h2>	 
	<p>Ever since I was little, I have loved horseback riding.
	 For many years, I worked with a rescued horse named Lilly. She was sassy
	  and opinionated, but did not have a lot of experience being ridden. During our
	   years together, we had many adventures â€“ I took her cross country schooling as well as to her first show! I was also on the riding team at my sending school.
	   Now, I ride a young horse named Rafiki who is only three
	   years old. We're still getting to know each other, but I'm hopeful
	   that we'll make a great team! Below, you can see me and Lilly schooling at the Groton Pony Club. On the right, I
	   am riding a horse named Soldier. We worked together for about six months, and he taught me
	   so much about body control while riding and the value of having a plan.</p>

	<h2 class="smallheading"> Summer Jobs and Cape Cod</h2>
	<p> This summer, I was lucky enough to work at an ice cream shop in 
	Harwich Port, MA. I spent all summer on the Cape, 
	which was super fun! Not only did I get a killer tan, I also developed a serious affinity
	for going out to eat; I even can't begin to count all of the new restaurants I tried! Although it wasn't great 
	for my bank account, I made the most amazing memories. Whether it was getting sushi
	 with my cousin, biking to the beach with my new 
	 best friends, or working all night at
	  <a class="doublelinky" href="https://www.seagullscc.com/pages/about-us" target="_blank">Seagulls</a>, 
	  there was always an adventure to be had.</p>
	<p> The picture on the left is from my first day of work. My coworkers and I became fast friends - 
	by the time it was time to leave for the summer, it felt like I was like leaving my family! We are already planning
	our next summer and I can't wait to see them again. As you can see, I am not the only one who loves the beach. My dog, Socrates is always happy to make
	a beach trip with us.

	<h2 class="smallheading"> Family and More</h2>
	<p>When I was younger, I tried my hand at a variety of different activities.
	 I participated in Destination Imagination for nine years and played the clarinet, too! I give DI all 
	 of the credit for the collaboration skills I have today - it pushed me to work with my
	 peers in high-stress settings, but also enjoy our accomplishments. I miss the tournaments the most.
	 No feeling compares to that moment you walk off the stage after a great (or not so great) performance!
	 I was also a Girl Scout for many years, and even played soccer.</p>
	 
	 <p> I have two loving parents and one younger sister. Both of my parents went to art
	 school, so our house is always filled with craft supplies and art projects!
	My love of animals certainly shows itself at my house. We share our home with a variety
	 of creatures, such as hermit crabs, a bird, a tortoise, and more. </p>
